</footer>    <div class="section"><p>A dear friend of mine pointed me towards the simple model that is the namesake of this post: ovens and conveyors. We define some terms first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine: Ovens, conveyors, and the other sorts of "machines" that we use.</li>
<li>Elements: The individual "things" that we feed into our system.</li>
<li>System: Any number of connected machines.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Model</h1>
<p>All machines of our model have a central idea: they take in elements from one end (the input), do something with those elements, and then put the elements in whatever machine they have on the other end (the output). A physical analogue of this is an assembly line - we have a big stockpile of raw materials, we place them on a moving conveyor belt, and we feed them into a machine that takes a certain amount of time to process them before placing them somewhere else.</p>
<p>To facilitate this model we use several abstract machines.</p>
<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>The things we input and output from machine to machine. They can be anonymous or not - that is, we might keep track of each element and its properties or we might just use interchangeable units.</p>
<h2>Conveyors</h2>
<p>The physical analogue here is a conveyor belt. Elements are placed on the conveyor belt and take a certain number of steps, ticks, seconds, units-of-time to get to the next machine. After a certain number of steps on the conveyor belt, an element is moved to the output machine. We refer to each step as a <em>stage</em>, with the first stage being <em>initial</em> and the last one being <em>terminal</em>.</p>
<p>Conveyors might have no limit to the amount of elements that can be placed on them or we can choose to implement a <em>piecewise capacity</em> - that is, each stage in a conveyor belt can have up to <strong>n</strong> elements on it at any given time. We'll explicitly note if a conveyor has piecewise capacities but otherwise assume that they're infinite.</p>
<h2>Ovens</h2>
<p>The physical analogue here is, well, an oven. Ovens are just conveyors with a <em>global capacity</em> - they can take in some number of elements in any order but can have up to <strong>n</strong> elements, where <strong>n</strong> is the global capacity of the oven. This is just some overhead over a conveyor. </p>
<p>This allows the possibility of empty stages!</p>
<h2>Sinks and Sources</h2>
<p>Sources create a stream of elements according to whatever logic we desire. They cannot intake elements. </p>
<p>Sinks take in a stream of elements and do nothing else with them. We can log them, if we want, and use them as "data collection" machines to track how the system as a whole is performing. They cannot output elements.</p>
<h1>Some Physical Analogues</h1>
<p>Okay, so this is all well and good. Let's actually get some intuition as to how these pieces fit together.</p>
<h2>Grocery Store</h2>
<p>You have finished shopping at a store and walk towards the express aisle. It takes you 5 minutes to get to the aisle, 5 minutes to checkout, and another minute to exit the store. If someone is already at the checkout you'll have to wait.</p>
<p>So: We have an conveyor belt with time 5, an oven with time 5 and capacity 1, and an conveyor belt of time 1.</p>
<h2>Grocery Store, Redux</h2>
<p>Instead of using only the express aisle we instead have 3 lines open. In this case we have a capacity of 3: the oven can process three people at once in parallel. These people have infinite patience - we'll consider finite patience next time.</p>
<p>So: We have an conveyor belt with time 5, an oven with time 5 and capacity 3, and an conveyor belt of time 1.</p>
<h1>Closing Comments</h1>
<p>Next time: we look into implementing some of these machines in Python! </p></div>
