<p>At the bottom of a well, there's a brick wall that's loose enough to disassemble. Behind it is the home of Doctor Alberta Hemingsworth, presumed dead for the last 12 years. The hardest part about faking her own death was pulling out some of her teeth; finding the poor homeless sap and pulling out her teeth wasn't that hard. And the houses around here were made of dry wood, just poised to explode in a fiery finale. So it was a pretty straightforward task.</p>
<p>The Doctor needed the privacy. She had solved the problem of food and water two decades ago, finding the solution in a book she stole from a travelling charlatan who didn't know what he had. Certain glyphs, certain chanted words, and a piece of your soul unlocked the secret of Breatharianism. The book wanted to frame it as a divine teaching from their God of some sort but Alberta knew much better than that. She had met and killed a few gods before that point.</p>
<p>Her parents were rich and bored and played at the occult, throwing money at conmen with robes and silver tongues. They spoke excitedly of Aleister Crowley, of Thelema and chaos magick, and hoped above all else to cheat death. They wanted to pass on their knowledge to their only daughter, a bright young girl. Her eyes shone back then. </p>
<p>Her life as a member of the human race ended due to a coincidence when she was 17 years old. One of her parents' friends brought them a text: "Immortal Sciences Revealed". It came from the 19th century, written by a lunatic in an asylum, scrawled on paper and only barely kept together. They decided to try reenacted a ritual described in the text - the "Beating Heart's Repose". The text described it as a tool for delving the Farlands, beyond life or death. They found a goat born with two heads, chalk, the hand of a murderer and the bone of a saint, and arranged them accordingly. Alberta watched from the side as her parents and their friend held hands in a circle and spoke profane words.</p>
<p>The coincidence was the time. Venus, Mars and Jupiter were in conjunction that day, a fact that was relevant but unknown both to the author of the ritual and the participants of the ritual. As they chanted they realized that something was wrong but their bodies moved of their own volition - they felt blood running down from their eyes as they were prisoners in their own flesh. A single thing took their bodies from them and their vision faded into darkness, and then greyness, and then a color that defied their thoughts. And then they were trapped there and are trapped there until the end of Time, if they're lucky.</p>
<p>The thing that emerged turned its six eyes and three bodies towards a wide-eyed teenager and spoke in three voices: "Why am I here?"
Alberta found herself speaking, "A mistake was made. You should not be here."
"But I am here."
"That's true."
The room was lit only by candles, illuminating crimson curtains hanging over windows. Alberta spoke next. "What do you want? What can you do?"
"I can do anything. I want to return."
"Well. Okay. You can do anything except return?"
"Hm." The thing grew thoughtful. "I need a favor from you, animal."
"Animal?" She thought for a second. "Okay, that's true. What's in it for me?"
"Kill these vessels and I will lift the veil for you."</p>
<p>Alberta grew up in an environment where power was the highest good. Her parents, dissatisfied with mere mortal power, sought power beyond humanity, and they instilled the importance of this into their daughter. When she was 7 they showed her how to drain the blood from a chicken. When she was 16 she was forced to strangle her pet dog, 13 years old but still spry, with her own hands. The only way she survived was unquestioning acceptance of the logic of power at all costs. So it wasn't a surprise when she picked up a knife left on a nearby table and stabbed the three bodies to death.</p>
<p>As the life drained from her mother, the thing stared into her and the veil fell. Any hope of ever relating to another human being ended that night. She burnt the house down and ran off into the night, holding only that copy of "Immortal Sciences Revealed".</p></div>
