</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Another stormy day in Stormworld. Jom Jom climbed down from the Storm Spires, having completed the routine maintenance for the weather machine that created storms. He wasn't really sure why more storms were needed, but you don't get paid for asking questions.</p>
<p>He proceeded to the underground bunkers, the only places safe from the necessary and important storms. They had all the necessities down there - food, water, and mind-altering substances. He didn't have any friends but he didn't need them because he had Friendium, the hot new designer drug that made it easy to create imaginary friends that were real to 4/5 of the senses (not taste). He was truly lucky to be alive!</p>
<p>He checked his credit chips. Uh oh, running low. This job would give him enough to survive for the rest of the month, <em>if</em> he didn't spend any on entertainment, which was impossible. He hadn't been sober for years and he wasn't planning to now. His watch beeped and ejected a tiny oval which he promptly tossed into his mouth.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the elevator (a costly luxury), he decided to take the stairs. Most people took the stairs, leaving the elevator empty for most of the day. It was musty and damp from the leaking roof, slowly deteriorating under the stress of the constant storms. Jom Jom was looking forward to the Roof Repair Lottery, where he might have the chance to win the right to take on the lucrative and dangerous work of repairing the roof. If he died, he was dead. If he lived, he'd have enough chips to live in luxury for a few months. Either way, a good deal.</p>
<p>Death! Oh, what a fantasy. It wasn't good to dwell on it too much. You died when it was your turn,  his parents would tell him. They weren't dead yet but they were much closer to it than he was. The queue was dreadfully long. You weren't told when it was going to happen. One day your watch beeps a funeral dirge and you report to where it tells you, and nobody ever sees you again. </p>
<p>At that moment, his watch beeped a funeral dirge. His watch beeped a funeral dirge. It. Beeped! A funeral dirge! He couldn't believe it. But there it was: the mournful tune, performed by tiny electronic synthesizers. His watch displayed the words, "REPORT TO SECTOR X9-39. PASSCODE IS 'BYE BYE BIRDY'." And off he went!</p>
<p>The tunnel walls were a shiny white metallic substance, painted with helpful slogans like "WATCH OUT FOR BRAIN FOG" and "HARD WORK IS WORTH HARD WORK". Posters of people's faces were put up with disclaimers like "Beautiful people look like this," and "Criminals look like this." He was glad he didn't look like a criminal. He didn't look like a beautiful person either, but few people did, and those that did were almost exclusively rich and powerful. That's probably why they were rich and powerful.</p>
<p>But he was going to be something better than rich and powerful; he was going to be dead. He was going to get to go to sleep for the first time since he was 12 years old, and not be forced to wake up to go do something else. He was going to get to close his eyes without his watch screaming at him for sloth. Amazing.</p>
<p>Sector X9 was at the outskirts of the bunker, and Room 39 was dingy and small. The walls were peeling plaster on concrete and the carpet was cheap shag. There was a single exposed lightbulb at the center of the room, hanging over a wooden chair. Jom Jom took the hint and sat on the chair, and then felt himself falling.</p>
<p>This was because he was falling. The floor had given way and the lightbulb above was growing smaller. The floor slowly shut and left him in pitch blackness. The only sensory input he had was the sound of rushing air and the feeling of the chair that he was gripping onto. All at once it stopped, and he was lying on an inflated platform; the fall had been broken and he hadn't been.</p>
<p>There was a light over a door ahead of him; a metal door with a push bar, labelled "EXIT". He didn't know what that word meant but he hoped that it was something worth moving towards. He struggled to find footing, rolling pathetically off the platform and pushing himself up off the floor. He heard the sound of metal scraping against metal and a soft screaming in the distance and decided that now would be a good time to hurry his pace. He scurried towards the door, pushed against it, and saw what was beyond it.</p></div>
