            <p>Orion's Belt shone brightly in the night sky. The wind was calm and the air crisp. Trees were hollowed echoes and the ground was dead grass. A squirrel twitched and writhed on the forest floor, the blood draining out of its body into the soil as if drawn by some invisible force.</p>
<p>As far as the scientists could tell, the phenomena began several days ago and was increasing in radius at a linear pace. Every living thing in the affected area was drained of all of its fluids - tree xylems were sucked dry, animals exsanguinated, bacteria burst like balloons. </p>
<p>Leaving the radius didn't stop the effects, but it didn't spread them either. So it was limited to a particular geographical region and it wasn't infectious, which ruled out something like a bacteria or disease. The leading theory at this point was "aliens" although "end of days" was a popular runner up.</p>
<p>Ursula didn't like either theory because she felt they were cheap explanations. In her experience the world did not have easy answers, and being able to blame something in space or the heavens for the events on the Earth was a little bit too tidy of an answer. She had volunteered for the exploration as soon as she had the opportunity. After plenty of experiences with rats, containers, and RV vehicles, they discovered that any airtight container would be sufficient to protect living things from whatever was out there.</p>
<p>Bobert Yonaka was be the first one to discover that this protection was limited in scope, that being in the region for too long would disintegrate hazmat suits. His name would be memorialized.</p>
<p>She had two hours. Her and her team arrived in a heavy-duty jeep, blasting through the forest towards the center of the circle. Their vehicle was loaded with whatever scientific equipment they could cram on there. "Gotta throw enough science at the wall and see what sticks," Ursula joked at her colleagues, who did not laugh.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At the center, the ground seemed to slope down. They continued to drive but seemingly made no progress, the vehicle moving but staying still. They dropped a mallet on the ground and it shot behind them into the air, away from them. Ursula made the call to stop, and they tried it again. The bag stayed put. She was the first one on the ground.</p>
<p>Space worked strangely here. They could move away from the center with ease, but every step towards it seemed to be thwarted. They would walk, and walk, and everything would look like they were moving except they simply weren't. It hurt their brains to think about. </p>
<p>Ursula remained in the jeep and decided to continue driving forward as her colleagues collected samples and data from around her. After half an hour she saw something nobody else did: a tiny obsidian obelisk on the ground. And it grew slowly but steadily as she she drove the jeep quickly nowhere. At T minus 60 minutes, the jeep crashed into the obelisk - her colleagues only saw the front of the jeep crumpling and Ursula lurching forward. She scrambled out of the jeep and found her way to an opening in the obelisk, invisible to anyone else, and without saying a word climbed inside of it. Her colleagues would later recount that she had climbed out of the jeep with wild eyes and run into the center before vanishing completely.</p>
<p>Ursula never returned but the phenomena ceased a few days later. The only clue was a radio transmission from Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, which said the following:
"STILL THIRSTY, PLEASE ADVISE."</p>
