</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Once upon a time, there was a magnificent castle in a sprawling forest. Around the castle there was a bustling city, filled with smiling faces all scurrying around, all doing their daily chores. A blacksmith hammered at a sword, fashioning it out of a metal not seen in the world. Tapestry weavers created intricate displays, impossibly detailed and complex. A young boy is rushing around trying to deliver goods between shops.</p>
<p>In the castle there was an old king, round and cheerful. He ruled his kingdom with wisdom and kindness, providing for his subjects and keeping them safe. He encouraged exploration and wanted to learn about the world around him. His guards and soldiers were armed with the finest weaponry but it rarely came to that, for the king maintained a robust cadre of diplomats who were well-versed in his craft. He was so beloved that he was simply called the Good King.</p>
<p>One day, he was in the woods hunting for sport, when he came across a young boy. The boy was lost, wearing tattered clothing and having a shallow affect. The king felt sorry for the boy and adopted him, raising him as the Young Prince and teaching him the ways of governance. Some of the king's advisors privately raised concerns about the Young Prince, worrying about his seeming cruelty and disregard for life, but the king had faith in the inherent goodness of his subjects. In the king's company, the prince was always on his best behavior, appearing as the best of them. But in private he sneered and cursed, looking for ways to assert dominance over others. It was for these reasons that a conspiracy was born in the heart of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The conspirators were trusted by the Good King; they were his advisors, his friends, his servants, and his soldiers. They were brought together by a single unifying purpose: to ensure that the Young Prince would never see the throne. They loved the Kingdom, and they loved the King almost as much, and for that reason they had to make sure that the Young Prince never had the chance to govern. The plot was hatched on a winter's night, in a room with a window looking out onto an arboreal snow.</p>
<p>Phela spoke first, as she usually did. "We must act soon."
The king's royal courtesan whispered, "What do you mean?"
"The prince grows older everyday, and more fit. He looks upon the king with hard eyes when he thinks that no one is looking. I fear for the king's health."
"Surely," a general in the army asked, "he would not go that far."
Phela shook her head. "No, I think he would. He would do anything for power."
The courtesan and the general fell silent. The king's personal cook spoke next. "I think you're right, Phela."
"Thank you, Eustice."
"But what can we do?"
"We must poison him."
There was a shocked gasp. The general spoke first. "The dishonor!"
The courtesan next. "The barbarity!"
The chef, finally. "We must." This was not something that was expected by the general and the courtesan, who wildly turned their heads towards the Eustice. Eustice's face was stoic - his wrinkled eyes shone with determination but his trembling brow betrayed his fear.
Phela nodded with the weight of a woman who knew, for a fact, that her words had meaning. Her cheeks, usually rosy and full, were drained of color. "The king must not know. He must believe it is illness. It must be a tragedy for the kingdom."</p>
<p>The plan was carried around a week later, when the king was away at a diplomatic summit. The Young Prince barked at the servants in the manor for his dinner and the chef knew that today was the day. He prepared the prince's last meal and mixed in the vile substance that he had obtained surreptitiously from a witch from a distant land. The food was served to the prince, who smiled cruelly at the chef as he brought the food.</p>
<p>"Eustice. Eat this for me." The prince's eyes were resolute and knowing, and in that moment Eustice knew that his fate was sealed, and with it the fate of the kingdom he loved. But out of that love he nodded and devoured the fatal meal. He died that night in his sleep.</p>
<p>The courtesan slipped and broke her neck. The captain was slain in battle, impaled mistakenly by one of his own men. Phela was found hanging in her room. The king's heart broke four times over as his trusted comrades died without good reason. In his weakness, he didn't notice the prince aiming an arrow at his head while they were hunting. The Good King's last image was his adopted son smiling over him, eyes laughing but mouth pressed into a sneer.  </p>
<p>When the prince returned, he wept and brought the sad news. They had been ambushed and the king was dead. He had been shot in the leg and barely escaped (a self-inflicted wound, of course). But the Kingdom would survive and that was a blessing. On the throne, the Young Prince took a new title and broke away from the title of old.</p>
<p>He named himself the Great King.</p></div>
