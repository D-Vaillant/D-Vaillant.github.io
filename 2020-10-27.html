</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Candles flickered in the cool night air, illuminating the crop circle. Three figures wearing green robes were hunched over at the center, holding paint brushes.  </p>
<p>Carly Vancouver, a middle-aged woman with tired brown eyes, pulled herself up and stretched. "My back is killing me."<br>
The other two figures followed, and there was a sound of joints popping. Ursa Minuette, a younger woman with jet black hair and empty eyes, scowled, "Keep this up and you won't have a back, Carly."<br>
The third figure held up their hands. "Now, now, now. We don't need any more conflict tonight."<br>
"Can it, pipsqueak," snapped Carly.<br>
The figure took this in stride. "Come on. It'll be fine. There's a few hours before the sun rises, and then we'll be home scot-free and we won't have to meet again like this."<br>
Carly muttered something under her breath. This act escaped Ursa's attention.  </p>
<p>Ursa tried staring the third figure down but soon gave up. No getting through with that one. "Fine, fine, okay. Back to it," she acquiesced. They slumped back down and continued the work of painting lines and symbols onto the flattened stalks of corn underfoot. After a couple of hours they stepped back to survey their work.  </p>
<p>It was your basic ritual circle - there's a circle, there's shapes inside of the circle arranged in descending containment patterns. On the inside perimeter a band of words in an unspeakable language spelled out a profane message. Esoteric symbols were scattered inside the circle without rhyme or reason - reason was antithetical to the work that had to be done after all. And in the center of the circle was a wrapped up bundle that moved softly. The smell of gasoline was dizzying for Ursa and Carly. It's impossible to know if it was just as dizzying for the third figure, who produced a lighter from someone on their person and opened it.  </p>
<p>"First, let's give thanks for the sacrifice. With their life cut short, ours will be extended."<br>
Carly and Ursa nodded their heads and repeated, "With their life cut short, ours will be extended."<br>
"Second, we throw curses at Heaven. Their perfection damns us all."<br>
"Their perfection damns us all."<br>
"Finally, we worship the ecstasy of flame. May it cleanse our sins."<br>
"May it cleanse our sins." They barely finished their echo before the figure dropped the lighter onto the center of the circle. There was a horrific screaming as the circle lit up almost instantly.  </p>
<p>Carly and Ursa turned and ran in opposite directions.<br>
The figure kneeled down to cradle the now-quiet sacrifice. They vanished, leaving their clothing behind to burn. They survived somewhere else.</p></div>
