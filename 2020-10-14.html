<p>His name was Franko Franky and he was fleeing from a horrible tragedy, the details of which are immaterial to his future. Because the ground below him opened up and he fell, fell, fell, landing on a soft mossy rock with only some bruising. He looked around, confusion mounting. A voice from the darkness did not help him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" The voice was thin, like a whisper, a gossamer.
He wasn't sure how to respond. "I'm a human being named Franko."
"What are you? Are you a liar? Do you love, or do you commit violence?"
This was a fun conversation. "I'm just a guy, okay? Trying to figure out where I am. Where am I?"
"I'm asking the questions." A hint of hostility. "This is my home, after all."
Ah. "Your home?"
"Yes. Where I live. Do you have a home?"
"I used to."
Sadness hung in the air for a moment.
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Me too."</p>
<p>A figure stepped out of the darkness. An old woman, her hair greying and her wrinkles well-defined, looked at Franko with pity. "You're lost, aren't you?"
With relief, he responded, "Oh my god, yes. I'm extremely lost. Where am I?"
"You're in the underlands. Under the land, is where the name came from."
"I gathered that."
"So you know that there's nothing else here, right?"
"Yes, I gathered that too. How do you survive? Are there other people? What's your name?"
She hesitated. "It's not easy, there are, Coda."
"No last name?"
"What's that?"
He could see that this wasn't going anywhere. "Okay, well then."
"Well then."</p>
<p>She shuffled uncomfortably. "The door is behind you. Please leave. I'll fix the ceiling on my own."
"Oh, sorry about that."
"It's not your fault. Causally, yes. But not morally."
"Well, that's the one that's more important, right?"
"Right."
They stared at each other. He could see the outlines of her furniture, but the room itself was otherwise pitch black. Not a lamp in sight. He picked himself up and turned around to face a small wooden door in smooth stone. The door opened easily.</p>
<p>He found himself in a long corridor, lit by candles on the walls. There were doors lining the walls, all identical. He made his way down - they were probably doors to other residences and he had had enough awkwardness for now. After a couple of minutes (how long, though?) he found the end of the hallway and a tall door. He pulled it open.
A vast courtyard greeted him on the other side. There was an uncharacteristic warmth in the air and the ground and walls were covered in a thick moss. Benches were arranged around an unlit campfire. There was nobody around except for a horrible emptiness. Franko felt a sadness that he couldn't pin down. Anxiety swelled in his chest.
He walked around a bit more. There were some toys left on the ground, some with moss growing over them. A wooden horse, a cup and a ball on a string, a few wooden dolls wearing different brown-sack tunics.</p>
<p>There were doors around the walls of the courtyard, all identical to the door he had just left from. He had no orientation whatsoever, no idea where to go. He wasn't even sure how this room wasn't pitch black - there were no candles in sight but there was a diffused light that filled the room, giving him just enough light to make out the things in the room. Without any direction he decided to find some help - he picked a door at random, to another long hallway.
He walked down the hallway, knocking on doors. He heard shuffling on the other side of a few of them but nobody answered. At one door, it creaked open ever so slightly and a voice hissed, "Go away, please," before closing just as slowly. Okay, this wasn't great. He almost wished he was back on the surface - it was hopeless and empty but at least it wasn't claustrophobic and creepy.</p>
<p>He finally reached something novel - a door with what looked like a brass outline. There was a star on it. He hesitated before knocking on the door. A man answered - stout, with a thick mustache and hard eyes. He was wearing a brown tunic and brown pants without any adornment - purely functional clothing. He held a knife in his hand. "Who are you?" he growled.
Franko hesitated. "I'm lost. I'm from above, I fell in here."
"Oh, okay. Follow me." The man stepped out (forcing Franko to take a step back) and slammed the door behind him, before abruptly making his way down the hallway. Franko rushed to keep up with him.
"I'm Franko, where am I?"
"I am the warden. You are home."
"Home?"
"Yes."
"I don't understand."
The warden turned to stare at Franko. "I don't care. You're here now, aren't you?"
"Yes, I suppose I am."
They reached their destination - another door. He pulled out a key from his pocket, unlocked the door, and handed the key to Franko. "This is where you live now. Food will be delivered twice a day."
Franko's stomach dropped. "Wait, no, I don't want t-"
"Nobody wants to," the warden interrupted. "Don't be unreasonable. This is just the way that things are." He opened the door, grabbed Franko's arm and pushed him in before pulling the door closed.</p>
<p>Franko blinked. The room was full of old, dusty furniture. He could see, but he couldn't see any light in the room. A candle, half-burnt, sat on the table in the center of the room.</p></div>
