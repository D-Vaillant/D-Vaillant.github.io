</footer>    <div class="section"><p>As it turns out, ghosts do exist. Well. "Exist." It's a bit odd.</p>
<p>There's a few facts about ghosts:
1. Animals are better at identifying them.
2. Ghost experiences, without failure, are associated with particular mental states and physiological reactions.
3. Scientific tools and methods are unable to identify or reproduce "hauntings".</p>
<p>We can explain all of these by explaining ghosts as a kind of emotional entity. They're creatures of intuition - we feel them, we can't feel them.</p>
<p>These realities are brittle compared to the reality of a wall or a lamp. The scientific method, skepticism, is sufficient to superimpose itself over their own realities and blot them out. A sufficiently skeptical researcher can march into a haunted house and suppress that creeping dread, that feeling of presence that most people feel in these sorts of places. </p>
<p>That's why ghosts don't exist in well-trafficked areas, in areas marked by cleanliness and modernity. The modern condition does not allow for the reality of the supernatural, so they're bulldozed down. But if you go out to the countryside, in the places where civilization borders, there are mysteries.</p>
<p>It's impossible to tell if the human instinct is in reaction to the existence of ghosts, or in reaction to the imagined existence of ghosts. But maybe they're the same thing - ghosts are creatures that are imagined, in the same way that a city or a government might be imagined. They're conglomerations of strange sensory experiences and emotional reactions, wrapped together into a compound entity. Strange sensory experiences aren't uncommon in our everyday life; we're just numb to it, we sweep them under the rug and move on with our lives. But if they happen in a long-abandoned church where moonlight streams down through the holes in the ceiling, our hearts sink and we posit things in the dark.</p>
<p>Imagined things in the dark are an evolutionary adaption. The dark is not a great place for human beings. We rely heavily on eyesight. And we tend to conglomerate around brightened places - houses at night, bonfires in the wild - and there is safety in numbers. We were more likely to survive if we avoided the dark and stuck to the light, and the human beings who avoided the dark lived long enough to teach their children to avoid the dark, and the lesson became instinctual. And that's because there <em>were</em> things in the dark that could hurt us, and kill us, and eat us, and cut off our genetic bloodline.</p>
<p>There's really two ways of looking at it. We might view our occult intuitions as evolutionary spandrels, byproducts of an instinct designed to keep us away from tigers. Or maybe it's our instinct working properly, trying to keep us away from things in the dark that we can't see.</p></div>
