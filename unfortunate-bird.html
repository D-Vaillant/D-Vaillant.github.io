    <p>The sun rises on a single, solitary ostrich. It removes its head from the ground[^1], shakes the dust and debris from its grey-speckled down, and looks into the distance. It is hungry. It must find food to survive. It must get a job.</p>
<p>The ostrich rummages around in its hole until it pulls out two sheets of paper (resume, cover letter). Today it is trying to work at a graphic design firm as a receptionist. It hoped that getting its foot in the door would make it easier for the firm to hire it as a designer. The ostrich could finally fulfill a lifelong dream of affecting the <em>zeitgeist</em> through its shocking, almost pornographic depictions of the cold violence that Mark Twain called the "longer, slower Terror". The ostrich was not a particularly talented graphic designer[^2] but it had courage and heart and that went a long way in this world.</p>
<p>The firm was nestled under a dense canopy of grasses, as it would be absurd for animals to be able to master the principles of human architecture to the extent that their construction of a design firm would echo that of a 21st century office building. It was occupied by an ostrich/hyena backed venture capitalist group who had hired a construction firm of various subterranean mammals who dug out large portions of the earth to create a vast underground network of tunnels and rooms. The CEO, of course, worked in the largest dirthole.</p>
<p>The ostrich found itself hunched over in a dirthole that was slightly too small for it, bending its head down. A rabbit sat behind a desk - she had promised the ostrich that it would "be right in", a lie she told effortlessly. A thought struck her: Was lying wrong? But she had no idea what "wrong" meant or why she should care about it.</p>
<p>Another ostrich popped his head out and asked him to come in. There was the customary "hello, how do you do” and a measure of awkward small talk where the employee asked the ostrich what he liked about the firm ("you will give me food so I do not die"), what drew him to the firm ("a company culture that promotes innovation and synergy"), and what he thought about Casual Thursdays instead of Casual Fridays ("I feel it is madness - Casual Friday is an easing-into the Weekends and moving it to Thursdays is a false promise. And having two casual days in a row takes away from the singular nature."). These answers were adequately professional for the employee, who did not care because he planned to kill himself tomorrow so that his wife and children could receive the benefits from his company-provided life insurance. The company was planning on rescinding this insurance in order to "save on costs," which was a euphemism for "the CEO needs another house for his secret second family."</p>
<p>The ostrich was led to a large conference dirthole. Inside, a large platform desk greeted the ostrich, where a lion and a hyena were sitting impatiently. The ostrich was understandably confused - why all of this formality for a simple receptionist position? But the employee left quickly without explaining and the ostrich crouched down at an appropriate distance from the hyena and lion.</p>
<p>The first to break the silence was the hyena (as to be expected). "So, hey, how are you doing?"
"I'm doing well today," croaked back the ostrich.
"Fantastic, good to hear. Me and my colleague Phil over here looked over your resume and we heard of your design work as well." The ostrich's heart dropped in its chest. It had to ease people into its work - it had no idea how Phil and the hyena had managed to discover its secret identity as BloodArtist83. But the ostrich had to keep its cool.
"Ah, yes. I am proud of my wor-", the ostrich choked midsentence and resumed two seconds later. "My work, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to best portray modern life in such a straightforward manner."[^3]</p>
<p>There was a moment of awkward silence, the reason for which is explained in footnote number seven. Phil broke the silence with a hammer.
"You fucking idiot. It was epicycles on epicycles - you're the artist, you must have known that it was anything <em>but</em> straightforward. We believed that the obscurity was part of the message, that by cloaking the straightforward in codes and ciphers you were making a commentary on how civilization proceeds by hiding what is true in favor of what is civilized."</p>
<p>Even the hyena joined in on the bloodbath: "Yeah, man, what were you thinking? Go on, explain yourself," he cackled.</p>
<p>The ostrich was utterly lost - it hung its head shamefully and muttered, "I don't know, I was hoping you guys would like it."</p>
<p>Another silence. The hyena explained, with a tone of condescension: "I'm a straight-shooter. When I shoot, it goes straight." Phil turned to the hyena in bafflement, having no idea what "straight-shooter" meant, but the hyena continued. "It's fairly clear that you're taking this position as a stepping stone to a designer position. But I'm going to save you the time and effort because we're never going to hire you. Do you know how I got this job?” There was a pause. “My dad was friends with an executive. It was pure nepotism. And I earned that nepotism by being a well-behaved child.”</p>
<p>The hyena was clearly losing the thread here and Phil jumped in. “What my colleague is trying to say,” he lied, “is that you have the potential to have potential, and until then we would be remiss in wasting both of our times here. Namaste.”[^4]</p>
<p>And so the ostrich departed the office firm. It would resort to digging through the  canyon refuse to survive that night and possibly the next. What adventures lie in wait for our brave ostrich? We may never know.       </p>
<p>[^1] Ostriches do, in fact, hide their heads in the sand at night. Any suggestion to the contrary is an attempt to crush the magic and wonder out of life.</p>
<p>[^2] Its work was a bit juvenile, its beliefs a bit misshaped, and its proclivity towards shock was more motivated by titillation than principles.</p>
<p>[^3] At the risk of threatening my position as the objective omnipotent third-person voice: It is absolutely unclear why the ostrich thought that this was the correct thing to say. Its work was utterly obscure and relied on far too many layers of misdirection and irony in order to deliver a single, uninspired message: "Corporate life is bad and sad." </p>
<p>[^4] “Namaste”, in this context, meaning “Get the fuck out here.”</p>
