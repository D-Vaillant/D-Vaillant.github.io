</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A dear friend of mine pointed me towards the simple model that is the namesake of this post: ovens, conveyers, and queues. We define some terms first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object: Ovens, conveyers, queues, and the other sorts of "machines" that we use.</li>
<li>System: Any number of connected objects.</li>
<li>Elements: The individual "things" that we feed into our system.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Model</h1>
<p>All objects of our model have a central idea: they take in elements from one end (the input), do something with those elements, and then put the elements in whatever object they have on the other end (the output). A physical analogue of this is an assembly line - we have a big stockpile of raw materials, we place them on a moving conveyer belt, and we feed them into a machine that takes a certain amount of time to process them before placing them somewhere else.</p>
<p>To faciliate this model we add on several abstract objects which can be easily replaced with other systems. </p>
<h2>Queues</h2>
<p>A queue is just the CS 101 concept: it has a <code>enqueue</code> and <code>dequeue</code> methods which take in elements and then releases elements in the same order as they were taken in. The physical analogue is a queue (or "line").</p>
<h2>Conveyers</h2>
<p>The physical analogue here is a conveyer belt. Elements are placed on the conveyer belt and take a certain number of steps, ticks, seconds, units-of-time to get to the next object. After a certain number of steps on the conveyer belt, an element is moved to the output object.</p>
<p>Conveyers have no limit to the amount of elements that can be placed on them, although we can choose to implement a <em>piecewise capacity</em> - that is, each "space" in a conveyer belt can have up to <strong>n</strong> objects on it at any given time.</p>
<h2>Ovens</h2>
<p>The physical analogue here is, well, an oven. Ovens are just conveyers with a <em>global capacity</em> - they can take in some number of elements in any order but can have up to <strong>n</strong> elements, where <strong>n</strong> is the global capacity of the oven.</p>
<h2>The Abstract Objects</h2>
<p>These aren't part of the model, strictly speaking, but we include them because they make our life easier. They fall into two groups: sources and sinks.</p>
<p>Sources create a stream of elements according to whatever logic we desire. They cannot act as outputs. </p>
<p>Sinks take in a stream of elements and do nothing else with them. We can log them, if we want, and use them as "data collection" objects to track how the system as a whole is performing.</p>
<h2>Anonymous Elements?</h2>
<p>We have not yet touched on an important question about our implementation: are our elements anonymous or do they have identities? That is - is it important that we keep track of which element is which or are they just interchangable units? Our eventual choice here will lead to a difference in implementations - we will begin with anonymous elements and then adapt our implementation to allow for non-anonymity.</p>
<h1>Some Physical Analogues</h1>
<p>Okay, so this is all well and good. Let's actually get some intuition as to how these pieces fit together.</p>
<h2>Grocery Store</h2>
<p>You have finished shopping at a store and walk towards the express aisle. It takes you 5 minutes to get to the aisle, 5 minutes to checkout, and another minute to exit the store. The checkout line only holds 3 people at a time.</p>
<p>So: We have a conveyer belt with time 5, a queue before the checkout, an oven with time 5 and capacity 3, and a conveyer belt of time 1.</p>
<h2>Grocery Store, Redux</h2>
<p>Instead of using only the express aisle we instead have multiple lines open. As it turns out, this is a minor change: it still takes 5 minutes to get to the aisles and one minute to exit the store from the lines. However: we model all of the lines as <em>one</em> Oven, with a larger capacity (of 25) but with the same time.</p>
<p>So: We have a conveyer belt with time 5, a queue before the checkout lines, an oven with time 5 and capcity 25, and a conveyer belt of time 1. This is an example of how our objects can abstract away from some physical details and instead treat them as a single coherent thing.</p>
<h1>Closing Comments</h1>
<p>Next time: we look into implementing some of these objects in Python! </p>
