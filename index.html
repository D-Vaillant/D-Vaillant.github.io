            <p>"Welcome to the worst casino in the continental United States!"</p>
<p>It wasn't a reassuring greeting but it was certainly an honest one. A man in a polyester pinstripe suit wearing a garish white top hat greeted the party at the door, holding a Party City brand cane. Candice turned to her partner and whispered, "Where did you bring me."<br>
"The worst casino, of course." Juniper was beaming from ear to ear. She shook her head slightly to accentuate the swinging of earrings made of dice. "It's awful, I cannot wait. Entrance greeter man, where's the check-in counter?"<br>
The man took the disrespect with the grace of someone without dignity. "It's over to the right, behind the column so it's really hard to find."<br>
"Your right or my right?"<br>
"Oh, my right, so your left."<br>
"Thought so." Juniper gave Candice a reassuring smile that reassured no one. They carried out the business of checking in, getting their keys, taking an elevator, and arriving at their room.</p>
<p>The room was a masterpiece of disappointment. There was a single bed that was advertised as a queen but was definitely a twin. The television was a CRT, a bulky thing; it looked like it even had an integrated VCR. Light filtered in through the yellowing curtains; the reduced light in the room helped to hide the stains on the shag carpet flooring and the water stains on the walls. It lived up to the casino's reputation.</p>
<p>"This is surprisingly good," murmured Juniper, as she toured around the room opening up every drawer she could find.<br>
"Oh, great," Candice said. She had intended it to be sarcastic but it didn't land.<br>
"I know, right? Found the Bible, lemme see." Juniper flipped through it. "Someone drew some dicks in here. A lot of them, and in pen. I don't even think this room has pens."<br>
Candice had put down her bags and started unpacking. She barely registered Juniper pulling the carpet up off the floor, but she did register it.<br>
"Juniper what the FUCK are you doing," acknowledged Candice.<br>
"Picked this room for a reason, love. Look, trapdoor." She was right - underneath the carpet was wooden flooring and a circle-shaped door. And she immediately pulled it open. "Could you grab the flashlights from my bag?"<br>
"I will <em>not</em>. Juniper, what is that? Why is it in our room?"<br>
"Trapdoor? Because they built it here?"<br>
Well, she had her there. Candice furrowed her brows and frowned at Juniper, who had gotten up and begun rummaging through her luggage.<br>
"Okay, you're right. Sorry Candice. Should have mentioned it sooner." Juniper was attaching a very large knife to her belt.<br>
"This isn't a holiday, is it?"<br>
"Nope. Sorry love, you probably should have guessed though. Did you not google the place?"<br>
"Uhm. Why?"<br>
"It's crazy haunted here. Many suicides. People usually think that it's the shittiness of the place but we know better, don't we?"<br>
"Whatever. Hand me the body armor."<br>
"Couldn't find your gun, is that okay?"<br>
"No, I brought that one myself. Can't trust you at all." She gave Juniper an insincere smile.  </p>
<p>A dropped glowstick fell for a few seconds before landing about 50 feet down. They hammered in some stakes to attach a rope ladder, put on some headlamps, and began their journey down.</p>
