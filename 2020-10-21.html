</footer>    <div class="section"><p>Tyronius slew the serpent. Felixus conquered the manicore. And now, at the top of the mountain, Yowron gripped his spear in his clenched white knuckles. The wind around him whistled around his ears. His breath was shallow, trying to find purchase in the thin air around him. The ground beneath him was speckled with snow and gravel and grass clinging to life in an impossible place. He couldn't see below, anymore - clouds blanketed the mountains around him. The only place to go was forward, towards the Nest. That was where the eagle lived.</p>
<p>For men in his village, there were a few choices. You could be born to a man in a position of power, ensuring that you would inherit their position. You could be especially beautiful, a blessing from the Gods that indicated their favor. You could relegate yourself to working as a simple laborer, living and dying at the whims of others. Or you could fashion yourself a hero, set off into the wilds and return with proof of your heroism. Yowron had heard the stories since he was a child - Yu'kal taming the great lion, Helun and his one hundred dog army, the Unknown Warrior who accomplished monumental deeds that have been lost to time. He had always wanted to be a character in one of these stories, a brilliant and powerful man with long hair that would perpetually be blowing in the wind. He dedicated himself to this, honing his body and his skills. He grew out his hair.</p>
<p>The path here was a lot less perilous than he expected. He left the village, supplies on his back, and headed west. The road was well-marked and he found his way to neighboring villages fairly easily, where he was greeted with generosity in exchange for labor and stories. He heard about a fantastic and murderous eagle that lived on the peaks, coming down to kidnap young children and steal them away. He decided that that was his story - he could find and slay this kidnapping bird. And he practiced telling this story as he pursued it, telling of his arduous journey up until this point and the destiny that rose up ahead of him.</p>
<p>Now he stood facing that destiny. Ahead of him was an enormous nest, and inside that enormous nest there was a very large eagle surrounded by bones of varying sizes and animals. It was staring at Yowron fixedly, having heard his approach long before he made eye contact. The two stood facing one another.</p>
<p>They continued to stand, facing one another. Yowron felt a bit awkward.</p>
<p>The eagle spoke first. "What do you want?"<br>
"What?"<br>
"What. Do you want?"<br>
Yowron wasn't really sure how to handle this situation. He'd never heard a story where the great questing beast started speaking to the hero. But he knew who he was, and why he was here: "I'm here to stop you from murdering children, you monster." <br>
"Oh." The eagle was a paragon of nonchalance. <br>
"How dare you! Oh?!" Yowron was kind of forcing the outrage at this point, having been thrown off this much that he had to reorient himself.<br>
"Well, okay. I did that. But I'm a giant bird. I have to feed myself, you understand."<br>
Yowron understood a little bit more than he wanted to admit to himself. "I'll never understand a creature like you," he lied.<br>
"Ah, okay then. So you're going to try to kill me?"<br>
Wow, he was really deflated at this point. He wasn't going to include this part when <em>he</em> was telling the story. "Yes, I am."<br>
"Is this for a story?"<br>
"Oh for f-", Yowron began. His face was growing red, his eyebrows furrowed as much as they could. "Yes! I'm going to kill you, and talk about how hard it was! And then they'll tell that story, and I'll live on forever! Is that what you wanted to hear? Huh? Huh?" He was growing frantic, on the edge of panic.<br>
"Have you ever heard a story about a man slaying a bird?"<br>
"No! Not until the one I'm about to make!"  </p>
<p>"It's because," the eagle spoke, "birds can fly." And it flew off.</p></div>
