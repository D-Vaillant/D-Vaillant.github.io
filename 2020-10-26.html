<p>Oh, you're interested in higher dimensional spaces? Well. I really shouldn't. You know how they are about the higher dimensions - the government wants you to have a license for each dimension above three, and then everything above five is highly regulated, and then ten and above is just illegal. Unless you're rich, I guess! Oh, that's a half-joke. But I guess there's no harm in <em>showing</em> you. Over here.</p>
<p>This is a basic hypercube. Just a cube in 4-space. We consider this a beginner model for people interested in higher dimensional geometries; it's a cube, but in four dimensions instead of three. You have a square, you have a cube. Just the next step in that. It looks like a cube until you try moving it around - here, give it a shot. You see the trail? You're moving it in the future a bit as well, the whole thing. But at least that one's comprehensible.</p>
<p>Over here is a 6-dimensional poly-octagonal structure. This one's a bit of an advanced thing. I see people coming in here, thinking that they know how to deal with the higher geometries just because they read a book and played around with some 4-dimensional objects. Honestly, they'll give licenses to anyone. I'm not one to turn down a sale as long as they sign a lot of liability waivers because almost always - I can't believe how many times I've seen this, you wouldn't believe it - they end up displacing themselves and come back in missing limbs because they shunted it to a higher dimension or something. Those are the lucky ones. The ones who displace their consciousness are really sad.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet you didn't know about that one huh? It'll probably be more of a thing in a few years when people get bored of 4-dimensional objects and want to kick it up a bit. I know Walmart was trying to sell 7-dimensional spheres in its stores. Can you believe it? People don't need 7-spheres. But they like to say that it's their "constitutional right" or whatever. Sorry, I get a bit worked up about this. I take these things seriously, you know? And it really bums me out to see other people messing around with them without a care in the world until they accidentally shatter their psyches or the psyches of the people around them. We have a couple of 7-spheres and we keep them in the back under lock and key, because those things are dangerous to the mind. They're fantastic quality though, freshly harvested and everything. A real shame what they had to do those mathematicians to get them.</p>
<p>You're good for now? Well, don't be a stranger. Tell your friends: if they need a shape, here's the place.</p></div>
